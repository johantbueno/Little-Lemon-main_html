# Little-Lemon-main_html
This project is a website for a fictional restaruant called Little Lemon. It was created to practice the fundamental concepts in HTML and CSS such as using semantic elements, grids, flexboxes, animations, and responsive design. The Little Lemon website consists of four pages:

Homepage
Menu
Reservations
Contact Us
Navigation Bar
All webpages within the Little Lemon website have a responsive navigation bar. The navigation bar not only contains all the links to each webpage but also includes an animation on the Little Lemon title. When hovering over the Little Lemon text, the title glows and pulses yellow as seen in the gif above.

Homepage
The homepage has three main components, an image slider, a photo gallery and a set of action cards. The image slider uses an animation to automatically sequence through a series of images. The photo gallery uses a grid to showcase a set of foods and drinks. The action cards are links to the other remaining pages.

Menu
The menu page has two main components, a photo gallery and the complete Little Lemon's menu. The photo gallery uses a wrapped flexbox to display images of menu options as well as their descriptions and prices side by side. Below the gallery is the complete menu that is laid out using a grid.

Reservations
The reservation page is a simple webpage addressing customers to contact Little Lemon during operating hours to reserve a table.

Contact Us
The contact us page is a simple webpage displaying Little Lemon's phone number, address, and hours of operations, as well as, a form (front-end only) to contact Little Lemon.

Responsiveness
To create a responsive website, media queries were incorporated to format the various webpages differently depending on the screen dimensions. Additional, to create scalable text, all font-sizes utilized rem and scaled the font-size for the html element either up or down based on the screen dimensions.
